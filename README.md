# 🔒 Laser Security Alarm System

A simple and cost-effective *Laser Security Alarm System* designed using basic electronics. This system detects intrusion by monitoring a laser beam falling on an LDR and triggers an alarm when the beam is interrupted.

## 📌 Overview

- Laser light falls continuously on an *LDR*.
- When an intruder breaks the laser beam, LDR detects the drop in light.
- A *transistor-based circuit* senses this change and activates a *buzzer*.
- Simple to build, low-cost, and effective for basic security.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

- The *laser beam* targets the *LDR*.
- When the beam is interrupted, the LDR's resistance changes.
- This triggers a *transistor* which turns on the *buzzer*.
- System can be enhanced with a *manual reset* or *timing circuit*.
